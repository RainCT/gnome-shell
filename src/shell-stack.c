 * SECTION:shell-stack
 * @short_description: Pure "Z-axis" container class
 *
 * A #ShellStack draws its children on top of each other,
 * aligned to the top left.  It will be sized in width/height
 * according to the largest such dimension of its children, and
 * all children will be allocated that size.  This differs
 * from #ClutterGroup which allocates its children their natural
 * size, even if that would overflow the size allocated to the stack.
